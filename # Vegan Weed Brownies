# Vegan Weed Brownies
## Ingredients

In the world of marijuana-infused edibles, brownies are still king. But while many of us can simply grab a box mix and go, those who are looking for a vegan option have things a little tougher. But luckily, this simple recipe for brownies omits eggs and dairy, while still turning out a reliably chewy and delicious batch every time. This is a must-try for anyone looking to bulk up their catalog of recipes for vegan edibles!

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup dark brown sugar
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp vanilla
- ¾ cup cocoa powder
- ½ cup canna-oil
- ½ tsp baking powder
- ½ cup chocolate chips (optional)

The canna-oil used in this recipe should be made from vegetable oil for best results, but coconut oil is a perfectly good option if you enjoy the slight flavor it gives to the finished product. Chocolate chips are optional, but they definitely add a layer of decadence and richness to the brownies (for a fully vegan brownie recipe, make sure the chocolate chips are dairy-free).

## Directions
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F.
2. Pour 1 cup water and 1 cup of the flour into a saucepan, and cook it over low heat for about 10 minutes or until it turns into a glue-like paste. Remove it from heat and let it cool to room temperature. Note: Yes, it sounds kind of nasty, but you’ll understand when you’re biting into a chewy and rich brownie!
3. Mix sugar, salt, cocoa powder, and vanilla in a large bowl and add your canna-oil.
4. Add the other cup of flour and baking powder to the mixture, as well as the chocolate chips if you’re adding them. Mix well, until completely incorporated.
5. Using a spatula, spread the mixture into a greased 11″x7″ pan.
6 Bake for 25 minutes at 350°F. Brownies are done when you can insert a knife into the center of the pan and it comes out clean.

This recipe should yield about 12-16 servings and takes about 45 minutes to prepare.
